
The below represents the server response JSON schema from a web service written for a car rental company. 
This is usually a lot more elaborate and decomposed but for the sake of this exercise below is the single response.
Below is the schema definition
  "Car" : {
     "make": <String>
	  "model": <String>
     "vin": <String>
     "metadata" : {
         "Color" : <String>
         "Notes" : <String>
         }
     "perdayrent" : {
        "Price" : <Float>
         "Discount" : <Float>
         }
     "metrics" : {
         "yoymaintenancecost" : <Float>
         "depreciation": <Float>
         "rentalcount" : {
             "lastweek" : <Int>
             "yeartodate" : <Int>
             }
         }
    }
    
    The web server will return the response. You will always receive a list of cars from the server. 
    
    An example of the response is:
     "Car" : {
     "make": "Audi"
	  "model": "A7"
     "vin": "09AGHY64352JITEG98K"
     "metadata" : {
         "Color" : "Black"
         "Notes" : "Scratches on the front side of the car"
         }
     "perdayrent" : {
        "Price" : 140
         "Discount" : 15
         }
     "metrics" : {
         "yoymaintenancecost" : 2190.76
         "depreciation": 2256.43
         "rentalcount" : {
             "lastweek" : 4
             "yeartodate" : 221
             }
         }
    }

    Question 1: Print all the blue Teslas received in the web service response. Also print the notes
    Question 2: Return all cars which have the lowest per day rental cost for both cases:
    				a. Price only
    				b. Price after discounts
    Question 3: Find the highest revenue generating car. year over year maintenance cost + depreciation is the total expense per car for the full year for the rental car company.
    			The objective is to find those cars that produced the highest profit in the last year
